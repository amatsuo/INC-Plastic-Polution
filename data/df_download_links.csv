0,INC-5 on plastic pollution (part 1),"<div><div><div><span>
  <span>In March 2022, at the resumed fifth session of the UN
  Environment Assembly (UNEA-5.2), a historic resolution was adopted to develop
  an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including
  in the marine environment.<br>
    <br>
    The resolution (5/14) requested the Executive Director of the UN
  Environment Programme (UNEP) to convene an Intergovernmental Negotiating
  Committee (INC) to develop ""the instrument,"" which is to be based
  on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic,
  including its production, design and disposal.<br>
    <br>
    The INC began its work during the second half of 2022, with the ambition to
  complete the negotiations by the end of 2024. The first session of the INC
  (INC-1) took place in Punta del Este, Uruguay from 28 November to 2 December
  2022, followed by a second session (INC-2) from 29 May to 2 June 2023 in
  Paris, France, and a third session (INC-3) from 13 to 19 November 2023 in
  Nairobi, Kenya. The fourth session (INC-4) took place in Ottawa, Canada, from
  23 to 29 April 2024.&nbsp; The fifth session
